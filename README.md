## Connection 

Connect the Arduino's SCL and SDA pins to the I2C module's SCL and SDA pins. and then connect or solder the module to an LCD display.


## What is I2C

I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a two-wire, synchronous, serial communication protocol used to enable communication between devices over short distances, such as between a microcontroller and peripheral devices like sensors or memory chips. It's widely used in embedded systems and other applications due to its simplicity and efficiency.
